                <p>
                    Our company is the result of a dire community need to help police officers better manage stress in
                    one of the world’s most dangerous jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we’ve realized that other high value, high stress occupations can also benefit from the solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our founders, a retired chief of police, relayed the story of a police officer’s wife who
                    said the constant stress from facing the terrors of daily incidents had turned her husband into
                    someone she doesn’t know anymore. At his retirement party, she said something has to be done for him
                    and his fellow officers, because she was afraid his retirement will be a short-lived period of
                    torment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we assembled a group of data scientists, technologists and software engineers to find a solution,
                    using the latest developments in biometrics and artificial intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result is <strong style="color:#023047">Code4Pro</strong>.
